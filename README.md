## Recommendations

The following recommendations utilize the quantified findings to drive actionable steps for maximizing revenue and operational efficiency :

1.  **Optimize High-Profit Item Promotion:** Since Espresso and Coffee are primary profit drivers , resources should be focused on marketing high-margin complementary goods (e.g., specific bakery items) that can be bundled with Espresso to increase the Average Order Value (AOV) .
2.  **Strategic Staffing based on Trends:** Leverage the Peak Hours trend and Rush-hour Heatmap to schedule staff optimally, ensuring adequate coverage during high-volume windows (e.g., between 12 PM and 3 PM) to maximize order throughput and customer satisfaction .
3.  **Targeted Branch Improvement:** Analyze the variance in product performance across branches (e.g., category sales by branch ) and the Branches Status over time waterfall chart . Specific interventions should be designed to replicate the sales success of top-performing locations (e.g., Lower Manhattan) in branches showing relative underperformance.
